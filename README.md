# ENTcalendar

ENTcalendar is a hobby CRUD-project aimed at creating a personal diary for tracking TV shows, games, and movies that you've consumed recently.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features
- Track and log TV shows, games, and movies.
- User authentication with Auth0.
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Data storage using PostgreSQL.

To set up this project locally, you need to have the following tools installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or later)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (version 12 or later)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) (optional, for deployment)

- ### Installation
